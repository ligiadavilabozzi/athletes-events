# Analyze data in pandas

In this project, data analysis with python and pandas is applied to analyze data from athletes from the last 120 years of olympics. Some of the analyzes performed used:

- `left join`
- `pivot`
- `group by`
- `max`, `min`, `mean`

## **Data analysis**
### Tasks: 
1. Report all datas that the year is greater than 1980 and report all datas where Team is equal China, United States, Italy or Spain. 
2. Left Join to combine tables 'df_athletes' and 'df_regions'. Set the column NOC as the key column.
3. Pivot the df_regions with index = 'region, columns = NOC, values = notes.
4. Group the entries of df_athletes by the columns 'Season' and 'Medal and anwser 'in which Olympic games did the first group of athletes participate?"
5.  Compute the max and the min on the column Age. Compute the mean on the columns Weight. obs. aggregation operations on df_athletes. 

## **Learning Outcome Addressed**
Analyze data in pandas and python3.
